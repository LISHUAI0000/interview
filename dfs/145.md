# LeetCode 145 Binary Tree Postorder Traversal——hard
```

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Example:
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [3,2,1]

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


思路：
1、递归：left、right、root
2、循环：这里用到一个trick：左右根：将他逆序其实就是根右左
所以：可以按照根右左的顺序来访问二叉树、但是添加到list的时候是逆序添加
Let's start from the root and then at each iteration pop the current node out of the stack and push its child nodes. In the implemented strategy we push nodes into stack following the order Top->Bottom and Left->Right. Since DFS postorder transversal is Bottom->Top and Left->Right the output list should be reverted after the end of loop.
