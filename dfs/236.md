# LeetCode 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree——medium

```
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.

思路：
1、自上往下寻找
2、如果找到p或q、或者root为null、则返回root
3、不然寻找往左子树left、右子树right继续寻找
4、如果left、right都不为空、则证明root就是LCA
如果left为空、则返回right（证明p、q都在right子树中，right为LCA）
如果right为空、则返回left（证明p、q都在left子树中，left为LCA）
