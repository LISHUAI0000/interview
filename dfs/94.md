# LeetCode 94 Binary Tree Inorder Traversal——medium


```

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Example:
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


思路：
1、递归：按照left、root、right的顺序遍历
2、循环（即迭代）：
We push all the left children of root into the stack until there's no more nodes.
Then we pop from the stack which we'd call cur.
Add cur to result list
Recursively all the left children on cur's right child.
