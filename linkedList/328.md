# LeetCode 328 Odd Even Linked List——medium

```
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
Example 1:
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL

Example 2:
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL

Note:
The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
```


```
思路：
1、和86题partiiton list非常相似
2、只不过这里的分类情况变成了，第奇数个一个链表、第偶数个另一个链表
3、所以还是设定两个dummy链表头、两个遍历节点p、遍历head链表
4、将其分到两个链表中、然后再连接起来即可
```
