# LeetCode 237 Delete Node in a Linked List——easy

```
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:
    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9

Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

Note:
The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.
```

思路：
1、因为这里没有前一个节点，所以必须把当前节点变成前一个节点
2、直接把后面节点的val给当前节点、然后将后面节点删除便完成了当前节点的删除
