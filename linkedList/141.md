# LeetCode 141 Linked List Cycle——easy

```
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

```

```
思路：不用额外的space
1、利用两个指针：slow、fast
slow走一步、fast走两步
2、如果链表有环的话，那么fast必然会追上slow、然后他们必然会相遇
3、所以在没到null的时候如果slow == fast、则有环

Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing around a circle track. The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner. Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The fast runner is just one step behind the slow runner. In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.
How about other cases? For example, we have not considered cases where the fast runner is two or three steps behind the slow runner yet. This is simple, because in the next or next's next iteration, this case will be reduced to case A mentioned above.
