# LeetCode 53 Maximum Subarray

```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Example:
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

# idea
```
动态规划，一直累加，每次累加的时候判断maxcur是否小于0，小于0则maxcur=nums[i]，大于0则maxcur+=nums[i]
然后记录整个循环过程中maxcur出现过的最大值便是answer
