# LeetCode 189 Rotate Array

```
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

# 思路：逆转数组
```
Let n=7 and k=3.
Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result
Complexity Analysis
Time complexity : O(n). n elements are reversed a total of three times.
Space complexity : O(1). No extra space is used.
