# LeetCode 70 Climbing Stairs——easy

```
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


思路：dp
1、由题意可知
如果要走到n步的话，可以是n-1步再走一步、也可以是n-2步再走两步
dp（n） = dp（n-1）+ dp（n-2）；
