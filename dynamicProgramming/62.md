# LeetCode 62 Unique Paths——medium

```
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

思路：dp
1、由题意可知：只可往下或者往右走
定义dp【i】【j】：表示在这个位置上时的unique paths
则dp【i】【j】 = dp【i-1】【j】 + dp【i】【j-1】
2、dp【1】【1】 = 1；初始化值
其余都靠计算得到
