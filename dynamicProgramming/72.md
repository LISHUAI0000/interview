# LeetCode 72 Edit Distance——hard

```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')


思路：dp
1、
If the last character is the same, i.e. word1[i] = word2[j] then
D[i][j]=1+min(D[i−1][j],D[i][j−1],D[i−1][j−1]−1)
and if not, i.e. word1[i] != word2[j] we have to take into account the replacement of the last character during the conversion.
D[i][j]=1+min(D[i−1][j],D[i][j−1],D[i−1][j−1])
So each step of the computation would be done based on the previous computation, as follows:

```
The obvious base case is an edit distance between the empty string and non-empty string that means D[i][0] = i and D[0][j] = j.
Now we have everything to actually proceed to the computations
