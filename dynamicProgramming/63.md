# LeetCode 63 Unique Paths II——medium

```
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
Example 1:
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right


思路：dp
1、和62题是一样的思路
2、不过多了一个障碍物、其实就是当这个点是障碍物的时候、这个位置是不可能到达的所以这个位置
的unique path = 0；即dp【i】【j】 = 0
3、其余的不变、还是照常计算
dp【i】【j】 = dp【i-1】【j】 + dp【i】【j-1】
