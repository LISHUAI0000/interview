# LeetCode 97 Interleaving String——hard


```
Given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.
Example 1:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false

思路：DFS超时、必须要加DP、空间换时间
dp[i][j]: whether the first i+j elements of s3 is the interleaving string of first i elements of s1 and first j elements of s2
So, the transition formula is:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] & s3[i+j-1] == s1[i-1]) || (dp[i][j-1] & s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
