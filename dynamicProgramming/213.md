# LeetCode 213 House Robber II——medium

```
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
Example 1:
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

思路：dp
1、将环circle给解开是关键
2、其实对于每个点来说无非是两种情况、rob或者不rob、然后顺带影响到其相邻的节点
3、这里我们选择起点0来做选择：
也就是说如果我们rob nums【0】、那么最后一个点就肯定不能rob
所以也就是在0——nums.length-2的数组范围内进行计算
如果不rob nums【0】、那么最后一个点就可以被rob
所以也就是在1——nums.length-1的数组范围内进行计算
4、然后在这两个最大值中取较大值
5、而如何计算这两个最大值直接利用198题的函数即可。
